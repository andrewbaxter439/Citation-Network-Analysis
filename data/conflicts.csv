s  by working through the Institute for Youth Development 101  In 1998  the Institute had solicited funding from tobacco  companies  pointing out that although tobacco companies  had youth smoking prevention programmes  â  â  this approach  is suspect by industry critics and the general public because it  is seen as neither independent nor unbiased  IYD  Institute  for Youth Development  in part provides
 an effective answer  to that dilemmaâ  â   105 PM provided funding 106â  108 and  in 1999   corporate affairs indicated that PM intended to work through  the Institute to â  â  implement an outreach plan with different  health and medical groups in key statesâ  â   101 In Virginia  the  Institute had already co sponsored a youth development  conference with the go
n for Tobacco Free Kids  No â  â    it defended the  national 4 H councilâ  s decision to accept PM funding   PM also made overtures to tobacco control leaders working  in the area of harm and risk reduction 110â  112 But these  overtures sometimes aroused concern and possibly mistrust  among tobacco control advocates  For example  in reference  to planning a PM initiated meeting to discuss harm reduc   
or â  â  reasonableâ  â   tobacco control measures  just as Project  Sunrise proposed 116  Diminish funding  We found limited evidence of PMâ  s efforts to diminish  funding for tobacco control  In 1997  a draft letter from North  Carolina representative Walter Jones  found in the PM  documents  urged the Internal Revenue Service to investigate  the American Heart and Lung Associationsâ   political activ

organisations by publicising their  links to trial lawyers  Since the early 1990s  PM had provided  funding to the â  â  grassrootsâ  â   organisation Citizens Against  Lawsuit Abuse  CALA  to weaken trial lawyers and promote  â  â  tort reform â  â   which would also make it more difficult to sue  the industry 125â  127 However  we found no direct evidence in  the documents or in newspaper databases of
